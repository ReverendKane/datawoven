# Pain Points Tab

## Overview

The Pain Points tab is the foundation of your solution strategy. Every pain point you identify here becomes a potential automation opportunity. The key to maximizing the value of your Discovery Assistant results is connecting each pain point to the specific data sources that could address it.

**Critical principle:** A pain point without a data source connection is just a complaint. A pain point WITH a data source connection is an automation opportunity.

## Field-by-Field Guide

### Pain Name
**Widget Type:** Text Input (QLineEdit)
**Purpose:** A clear, concise identifier for the pain point

**Best Practices:**
- Use descriptive, searchable names (4-8 words)
- Focus on the problem, not the solution
- Use consistent naming conventions across your team

**Examples:**
- ✅ Good: "Weekly sales report generation takes 4 hours"
- ✅ Good: "Customer inquiry response time inconsistent"
- ✅ Good: "Manual invoice processing creates errors"
- ❌ Poor: "Reports are slow"
- ❌ Poor: "Bad customer service"
- ❌ Poor: "Too much work"

**RAG Impact:** These names become searchable tags in your knowledge base, helping the AI understand recurring themes across your organization.

### Priority Rank
**Widget Type:** Drag-and-drop ordering in table
**Purpose:** Establishes which pain points deserve automation attention first

**How It Works:**
- Items are ranked by their position in the summary table at the bottom of the section
- Drag items up or down to reorder priority
- Higher position = higher priority for RAG system development

**Strategic Considerations:**
- High-frequency, high-impact items typically rank highest
- Consider implementation complexity vs. benefit
- Quick wins (low effort, high impact) often make good starting points

**RAG Impact:** Priority ranking helps determine which AI solutions to build first and where to focus initial training data collection.

### Impact
**Widget Type:** Slider (returns float value)
**Range:** Typically 1.0 (low impact) to 10.0 (high impact)
**Purpose:** Quantifies how much this pain point affects your business

**Impact Level Guidelines:**
- **1-3 (Low):** Minor inconvenience, affects individual productivity
- **4-6 (Medium):** Affects team productivity, some business impact
- **7-8 (High):** Significant business impact, affects multiple teams
- **9-10 (Critical):** Major business impact, affects customer experience or revenue

**Examples by Impact Level:**
- **Impact 2:** "Have to manually update my calendar twice"
- **Impact 5:** "Weekly reports require data from 3 different systems"
- **Impact 8:** "Customer inquiries sit unanswered for 48+ hours"
- **Impact 10:** "Invoice errors causing customer complaints and payment delays"

**RAG Impact:** High-impact pain points become priority targets for AI automation, influencing which data sources get indexed first.

### Frequency
**Widget Type:** Radio Button Selection
**Available Options:**
- **Daily** - Occurs every day or multiple times per day
- **Weekly** - Occurs 1-6 times per week
- **Monthly** - Occurs 1-4 times per month
- **Quarterly** - Occurs every few months
- **Annually** - Occurs once or twice per year
- **Ad Hoc** - Occurs irregularly, triggered by events

**Selection Guide:**
- Choose the option that best represents the typical occurrence
- For irregular patterns, choose the most common frequency
- Consider seasonal variations (e.g., year-end reporting might be "Annually" but tax season could be "Quarterly")

**RAG Impact:** Daily and weekly pain points often offer the highest ROI for automation since small time savings compound quickly.

### Data Source Connection
**Widget Type:** Combobox with "Add Source" option
**Purpose:** Links pain points to the systems/data that could resolve them

**How It Works:**
1. Select from pre-populated sources (set by administrator)
2. If your source isn't listed, choose "Add Source"
3. "Add Source" opens popup requesting:
   - Source name (how your team refers to it)
   - Source type (Database, File System, Cloud Service, etc.)
4. New sources automatically appear in Data Sources tab for completion

**Why This Matters:**
- **Without data connection:** "We spend too much time on reports" → requires investigation
- **With data connection:** "We spend 4 hours weekly pulling sales data from our CRM and Excel files" → clear automation opportunity

**Examples of Strong Connections:**
- Pain: "Customer inquiry response inconsistent" → Data Source: "Customer Email System"
- Pain: "Inventory tracking manual and error-prone" → Data Source: "Warehouse Management Database"
- Pain: "Project status unclear to stakeholders" → Data Source: "Project Management Tool + Team Calendars"

**RAG Impact:** These connections directly inform which data sources to prioritize for indexing and what types of queries the AI should be trained to handle.

### Notes
**Widget Type:** Text Area (QTextEdit)
**Purpose:** Detailed description of the pain point and its context

**What to Include:**
- **Current process:** Step-by-step description of how things work now
- **Where it breaks down:** Specific points where problems occur
- **Who's affected:** Roles, departments, or customers impacted
- **Business impact:** Concrete examples of costs, delays, or errors
- **Attempted solutions:** What you've already tried

**Example of Comprehensive Notes:**
```
Current Process: Sales team manually exports weekly data from CRM (Salesforce), 
downloads customer communication logs from email system, combines data in Excel, 
then creates PowerPoint presentation for Monday morning meeting.

Breakdown Points: 
- CRM export often includes incomplete data requiring manual cleanup (30-45 min)
- Email logs don't always match CRM contacts (15-20 min verification)
- Excel formatting breaks when data volume changes (10-15 min fixing)
- PowerPoint creation is repetitive formatting work (45-60 min)

Who's Affected: 2 sales managers spend 2-3 hours each Monday, meeting delayed 
when reports aren't ready, sales director lacks real-time visibility

Business Impact: 4-6 hours of senior staff time weekly, delayed decision-making, 
inconsistent reporting format makes trend analysis difficult

Attempted Solutions: Tried CRM reporting tools but they don't include email data, 
looked into BI tools but seemed too complex for our needs
```

**RAG Impact:** Detailed notes help the AI understand context and suggest more sophisticated automation solutions beyond simple data retrieval.

### Attached Files
**Widget Type:** File Selection Dialog (QFileDialog)
**Purpose:** Supporting documentation that illustrates the pain point

**Recommended Attachments:**
- **Process documentation:** Current procedures or workflows
- **Error examples:** Screenshots of problems or failed outputs
- **Sample data:** Examples of inputs/outputs (remove sensitive information)
- **Email threads:** Communication showing the impact of this pain point
- **Existing tools/templates:** Current solutions that aren't working well

**Each Attachment Includes:**

### Screenshots
**Widget Type:** Built-in screenshot capture tool
**Purpose:** Visual documentation of pain points, especially UI/UX issues

**Best Screenshot Practices:**
- **Capture the problem:** Show error messages, confusing interfaces, or inefficient workflows
- **Include context:** Show enough of the screen to understand the situation
- **Annotate clearly:** Use arrows and pins to highlight specific issues

**Each Screenshot Includes:**
- **Screenshot File:** Auto-saved by the widget
- **Screenshot Location:** Auto-managed file path
- **Screenshot Title:** Descriptive name
- **Description:** Context explaining what the image shows
- **Annotations:** Visual callouts with notes
  - **Annotation Type:** Arrow or Pin markers
  - **Annotation Position:** Coordinates managed by widget
  - **Annotation Note:** Explanatory text for each marker

**Example Screenshot Documentation:**
- **Title:** "CRM Export Screen Confusion"
- **Description:** "The export options are unclear and we often select wrong date ranges"
- **Arrow Annotation:** Points to date selector → "This defaults to last 30 days but we need weekly data"
- **Pin Annotation:** Marks unclear dropdown → "No one knows what 'Include Dormant' means"

**RAG Impact:** Screenshots help the AI understand user interface challenges and can inform automation solutions that work around or replace problematic systems.

## Strategic Connections: Pain Points → RAG Solutions

### Tier 1: Simple Q&A Automation
Pain points connected to well-structured data sources (databases, structured files) often become straightforward question-answering solutions.

**Example:** "Finding customer order history takes too long" + "Customer Database" = AI that instantly answers "What did Customer X order last month?"

### Tier 2: Process Automation
Pain points involving multi-step processes with clear data workflows can become fully automated systems.

**Example:** "Weekly sales reporting takes 4 hours" + "CRM + Email System + Excel Templates" = Automated report generation and distribution

### Tier 3: Decision Support
Complex pain points involving judgment calls can become AI-assisted decision-making tools.

**Example:** "Pricing decisions inconsistent across sales team" + "Historical Sales Data + Market Data + Customer Communication" = AI pricing recommendations with justification

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Vague descriptions:** "Everything is slow" doesn't help identify automation opportunities
2. **Solution-focused naming:** "Need better software" isn't a pain point description
3. **Missing data connections:** Pain points without data sources require manual investigation
4. **Underestimating frequency:** Daily 15-minute tasks cost more than monthly 2-hour tasks
5. **Ignoring downstream effects:** Consider who else is affected when you delay or make errors

## Review and Validation

Before moving to the next tab, verify each pain point has:
- ✅ Clear, descriptive name
- ✅ Realistic impact and frequency ratings
- ✅ Connected data source
- ✅ Detailed notes explaining the current process
- ✅ Supporting documentation (files/screenshots where relevant)

Remember: The quality of your pain point documentation directly determines the effectiveness of your RAG system. Invest time here to maximize your automation opportunities.
